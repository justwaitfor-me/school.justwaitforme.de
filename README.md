## Introduction

Welcome to **{{project_name}}**! This project aims to [briefly describe the purpose and goals of the project]. Whether you're here to contribute or use this software, you'll find everything you need to get started in this repository.

## Project Structure

This project is organized in the following structure:

{{project_name}}/ ├── .github/ # GitHub workflows and CI/CD configuration │ └── workflows/ │ └── ci.yml # Basic GitHub Actions workflow ├── config/ # Configuration files for project setup ├── docs/ # Documentation files ├── src/ # Main source code directory ├── tests/ # Test files and test suite ├── scripts/ # Automation and utility scripts ├── README.md # Project description ├── LICENSE # License file for the project ├── .gitignore # Git ignore file for unnecessary files └── .env.example # Example environment file


### Explanation of Directories and Files

- **`.github/`**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows, like `ci.yml`, which automates continuous integration (CI) tasks such as linting, testing, and deployment.
  
- **`config/`**: Stores configuration files for various project-related settings (e.g., database configurations, API keys, etc.).

- **`docs/`**: Holds documentation files that explain how the project works, how to contribute, or any necessary technical details for users and developers.

- **`src/`**: The source code of the project. This is where the main application logic is implemented.

- **`tests/`**: Contains test files that ensure the code runs correctly and reliably.

- **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts for automating repetitive tasks (e.g., setup, deployment, etc.).

- **`README.md`**: This file! Provides a high-level overview of the project, installation instructions, usage details, and contribution guidelines.

- **`LICENSE`**: The open-source license for the project, ensuring proper usage and distribution.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files or directories Git should ignore, such as build files or sensitive data.

- **`.env.example`**: An example environment file to set up necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
